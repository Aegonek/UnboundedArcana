# Unbounded Arcana - Personal Homebrew Tweaks

Collection of my homebrew changes to Pathfinder: Wrath of The Righteous.

## Changes overview
1. Added cantrips scaling. Cantrips' scaling is balanced about idea that using class / archetype powers should be more powerful than cantrips. Still, they are a little more useful.
2. Removed "this spell has no effect on targets above N HD" mechanic, rebalancing the spells with that in mind. The only spells that retain HD limit are Sleep and Deep Slumber spell - I thought their instakill potential is too big to allow it. They were however granted significant scaling. You won't be able to instakill demon lords, but they may prove effective even against minibosses.
3. To qualify for "dextrous" combat maneuver feats, you need to have Combat Expertise OR Piranha Strike. This is intended to allow low-intelligence characters to access combat maneuver feats and to decrease feat tax.
